# Use `evtest` to find key names for your keyboard
key = "KEY_RIGHTCTRL"

# Optional modifier keys that must also be held
# Example: modifiers = ["LEFTCTRL", "LEFTALT"]

# Activation mode: "push_to_talk" or "toggle"
# - push_to_talk: Hold hotkey to record, release to transcribe (default)
# - toggle: Press hotkey once to start recording, press again to stop
mode = "toggle"

# Enable built-in hotkey detection (default: true)
# Set to false when using compositor keybindings (Hyprland, Sway) instead
# When disabled, use `voxtype record start/stop/toggle` to control recording

[whisper]
# Model to use for transcription
# Options: tiny, tiny.en, base, base.en, small, small.en, medium, medium.en, large-v3, large-v3-turbo
# .en models are English-only but faster and more accurate for English
# large-v3-turbo is faster than large-v3 with minimal accuracy loss (recommended for GPU)
# Or provide absolute path to a custom .bin model file

# Use "en" for English, "auto" for auto-detection

# State file for external integrations (Waybar, polybar, etc.)

# or provide a custom path. The daemon writes state ("idle", "recording", "transcribing")
# to this file whenever it changes.
